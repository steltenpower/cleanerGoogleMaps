# cleanerGoogleMaps
Some Suggestions to Google Maps and the like to limit pollution:

- Make cars no longer the default (depending the route cleaner options like trains, bikes, e-bikes, pedelecs, buses, walking) can be faster
- Put more effort in getting biking and walking routes on the map (many short, but important connections miss near where I live, resulting in bike detours, or more likely taking the car
- differentiate in bikes,The ones going faster or a lot faster are not rare anymore (speeds vary 10-45 kph nowadays)
- Include parking (time and money) in car trips
- Allow multi-modal; more ways of transportation in one trip
   (e.g. millions in the Netherlands use a combination of biking, walking and public transportation every day)
- Give an estimate of exhaust per route option. Include the least dirty route and moment (jams and high speeds are very dirty).
- As you measure pollution, give an estimate of how much pollution you inhale during your trip (in cars air usually just came out of exhausts in front of them)
- Use satellite pictures to detect chimneys and when they're used
- Make pollution levels not a somewhat hidden value
