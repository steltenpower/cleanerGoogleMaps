# cleanerGoogleMaps
Some Suggestions to Google Maps and the like to limit pollution:

- Make cars no longer the default (depending the route cleaner options like trains, bikes, e-bikes, pedelecs, buses, walking) can be faster
- Include parking (time and money) in car trips
- Allow multi-modal; more ways of transportation in one trip
   (e.g. millions in the Netherlands use a combination of biking, walking and public transportation every day)
- Give an estimate of exhaust per route option. Include the least dirty route and moment (jams are very dirty).
- As you measure pollution, give an estimate of how much pollution you inhale during your trip (in cars air usually just came out of exhausts in front of them)
- Use satellite pictures to detect chimneys and when they're used
